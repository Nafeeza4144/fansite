			 <p>Throughout the game, you'll notice that you start to pick up on some tricks to make things easier in the game. However, not everything is straight-foward. Part of the game experience is to struggle sometimes. If everything was given to you, the game would be boring. Not knowing everything make the game more intertaining because you have to explore the game to find what your looking for. While exploring the game, I came up with a few tricks of my own and just tips that I think are sometimes overlooked. </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Patience:This is very important because after a while of playing you need to manage your time. When you run out of stamina(the limit increases as you level up) there isn't much you can do. Of course you have to wait for your stamina to refill which can be a bad thing if you have limited time. Having very little patience can lead to mistakes like sweeping the wrong stages to buying the wrong item. </li>
            <li>Saving: Saving can not be stressed enough. Sure, at the beginning you get lots of gold and items but that won't last long. Soon, you'll have to use your gold wisely until you get the hang of the game. Limiting the amount of summonings you perform, the amount of items bought in the market and leveling up the important skills can all help out. </li>
            <li>Restaurant:The restaurant is a great way to make money and get shards for some M souls(Jello, Pudding, Sandwich, Skewer, Takoyaki, Strawberry Daifuku, Popcorn, Pancake),R souls(Ume Ochazuke, Omurice, Jiuniang),SR soul(Sushi) and UR soul(B-52). I recommend that you DO NOT use your tips to buy Exorcist's Gloves because it is not worth it. The ghosts do not effect the restaurant much. </li>
            <li>Skills: When making the best team for combat, it's important to make sure your souls are very strong. People tend to ignore the skills when leveling up the food souls and just worry about the soul power. This is a bad idea because a food soul with a high soul power can still be weak if their skills aren't leveled up. </li>
            <li>Fusion: As you collect shards, you'll see that you get more shards than others. Fusion lets your fuse shards that you don't need and get shards you do need. </li>
            <li>Talents: Before you start a battle, you have an option to pick two talents. The talents help you out during a battle. They can help heal the souls, damage the enemies or increase stats for your team. I recommend that you level up your talents.</li>
            <li>Guilds: Guilds are useful for items and if you need help from other players. It can be annoying is the guild is inactive but you just have to keep looking for the right one. </li>
        </ul>
